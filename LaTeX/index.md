## Overview

Welcome to the **part 2** of this course. Here, you will learn how to typeset documents (articles, reports, books, letters and beamers a.k.a. classes) using LaTeX. You'll mainly codes and texts and when compiled they render well formated documents. One needs to know a couple of commands to make a document look good. No worries here! You don't have to memorize everything since we have nice interfaces such as [texstudio](https://www.texstudio.org/), [texmaker](https://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/download.html) and the online most used one [overleaf](https://overleaf.com).


### Installion (texlive)

* [Windows](https://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet/install-tl-windows.exe)
* Mac: 
```bash
brew update
brew upgrade
brew install --cask mactex
```
* Linux
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install texlive-full
```

### How do we start a LaTeX document?

We start a LaTeX document with:

```latex
\documentclass[options]{article} % to write an article
```

The parameter `option` is optional. Common options are:

| Option       | Description                                                                 |

| `11pt`       | Font size 11 points                                                         |
| `12pt`       | Font size 12 points                                                         |

| `twocolumn`  | Typeset the document in two columns                                         |
